The editor copies the scene, and can reload it with no issues, as of now.
	Now all I need to do is use the UpdateInEditor attribute to update specific methods or properties while in the editor

7/16 Have to rework the forward method. It works for the most part, until I look left or right.

7/22 UI Plans.
	I don't think I should be able to attach UI components to regular entities. Since UI is screen space (Unless your using 3D UI), the way it transforms across the screen
		is different. (0,0,0) is always the center of the screen, no matter how I move a 3D camera in the scene, and I believe the sides of the screen are (1, 1) and (-1, -1).

	-UI Entity- The same thing as a normal entity, except it can only interact with UI elements/components.
	-UI Transform- all vectors in this transform are Vector2. There is no Z axis for a 2D screen afterall
	-UI Renderer- Example -Screen size is (1360, 768)- half of that is -(680, 384) == (0, 0) screen space-
		(Transform.X = 400 Transform.Y = 122) 1080 / 1360 = 0.7941176470588235... 506 / 768 = 0.6588541666666667
		UI Will be renderer at (0.7941176470588235, 0.6588541666666667) on screen
